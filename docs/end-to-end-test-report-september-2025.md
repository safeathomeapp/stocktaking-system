- **✅ Product Catalog**: Products properly linked to venues and areas with full metadata
- **✅ Stock Counting**: Quantity levels (decimal), unit counts (integer), location notes functional
- **✅ Progress Tracking**: Real-time calculation of completion percentage
- **✅ Multi-Session Support**: Multiple concurrent sessions across different venues

### **3. Venue & Area Management**

- **✅ Route Management**: React Router setup for all major components
  - `/` - Dashboard (main page)
  - `/stock-taking/:sessionId` - Stock taking interface
  - `/history` - Session history
  - `/venue/new` - Venue management
- **✅ Styling System**: Complete styled-components theming system implemented
- **✅ Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with tablet optimization

## ⚠️ **Issues Identified & Impact Assessment**

### **1. Session Completion Workflow**
- **⚠️ Issue**: `PUT /api/sessions/:id/complete` endpoint returning errors
- **Error Message**: "Failed to update session"
- **Root Cause**: Session completion logic may require additional validation
- **Business Impact**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Sessions remain "in_progress", reporting affected
- **Workaround**: Sessions can be created and fully used, status update is cosmetic
- **Recommended Fix**: Backend endpoint review and validation logic update

### **2. Stock Entry Updates**
- **⚠️ Issue**: `PUT /api/sessions/:id/entries/:entryId` endpoint not accessible
- **Status**: Cannot modify existing stock entries after initial creation
- **Business Impact**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Users cannot correct counting mistakes
- **Workaround**: Delete and re-create entries (if deletion endpoint exists)
- **Recommended Fix**: Implement entry update functionality for better UX

### **3. Venue Setup Automation**
- **⚠️ Issue**: New venues don't automatically receive default areas
- **Current Behavior**: Areas must be manually created for each new venue
- **Business Impact**: 🟢 LOW - Minor inconvenience in setup process
- **Workaround**: Manual area creation works perfectly
- **Recommended Enhancement**: Auto-create standard areas (Bar, Storage, Kitchen, etc.)

### **4. Data Export Functionality**
- **⚠️ Issue**: Backend CSV export endpoint not found in API
- **Status**: CSV export likely handled client-side (not tested in this session)
- **Business Impact**: 🟢 LOW - May be functional via frontend
- **Recommended Action**: Frontend UI testing required to verify export functionality
