**Output**: Smart dropdown with 20 relevant suggestions ranked by confidence
**Result**: Fast, intelligent product selection with learning capabilities

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **Voice Input Processing**
```
User Speech ‚Üí Browser Speech API ‚Üí Text ‚Üí Query Processing
"Becks two seventy five ml" ‚Üí "becks 275ml" ‚Üí Structured Query
```

### 2. **Multi-Strategy Fuzzy Matching**
```
Processed Query ‚Üí 5 Search Strategies ‚Üí Combined Results ‚Üí Confidence Scoring
```

**Search Strategies**:
- **Exact Match** (100% confidence): Direct name/brand matches
- **Brand+Category** (85% confidence): "Smirnoff Vodka" matches
- **Fuzzy Text** (40-80% confidence): Handles typos and variations
- **Phonetic** (70% confidence): "Shar-don-ay" ‚Üí "Chardonnay"

Returns ranked list with:
- **Product Name & Details**: "Beck's 275ml Lager"
- **Confidence Score**: 95%
- **Usage Statistics**: How often others selected this
- **Match Type**: Why this was suggested

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Architecture

### **Global Master Products Database**
```sql
master_products (
  id, name, brand, category, size,
  search_terms[], phonetic_key,
  usage_count, success_rate,
  venues_seen[], confidence_score
)
```
**Contains**: 15,000+ products from all venues you've visited

### **Smart Learning System**
```sql
voice_recognition_log (
  raw_audio_text, processed_query,
  suggestions_returned, selected_product,
  confidence_scores, processing_time
)
```
**Learns**: What works, what doesn't, improves over time

### **Venue-Specific Aliases**
```sql
product_aliases (
  master_product_id, venue_id,
  alias_name, usage_frequency
)
```
**Handles**: "House Wine" = "Kendall Jackson Chardonnay" at specific venue
