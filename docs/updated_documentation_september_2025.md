venues (id, name, address, created_at, updated_at)

-- Products: 5 test products per venue (beverages and spirits)
products (id, venue_id, name, category, brand, size, unit_type, barcode, created_at)

-- Sessions: Full lifecycle management
stock_sessions (id, venue_id, session_date, stocktaker_name, status, notes, created_at, completed_at)

stock_entries (id, session_id, product_id, quantity_level, quantity_units, location_notes, condition_flags, photo_url, created_at)

-- Future Enhancement Tables (Structure Ready)
invoices (id, venue_id, session_id, image_url, textract_data, processed_items, supplier_name, invoice_date, total_amount, status, created_at)
delivery_items (id, invoice_id, product_id, ordered_quantity, delivered_quantity, unit_cost, line_total)
```

## DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (VALIDATED)

### Working Configuration
- **Operating System**: Windows with Git Bash terminal
- **Project Path**: `/c/users/kevth/desktop/stocktake/stocktaking-system/`
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express.js on Railway (Port 8080 production)
- **Frontend**: React PWA (local development typically port 3000)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Railway with internal/external connection URLs
- **Version Control**: GitHub with auto-deployment to Railway main branch

### Essential Commands (All Tested Working)
```bash
# Backend operations
cd /c/users/kevth/desktop/stocktake/stocktaking-system/backend
railway logs  # Check production logs
railway up --service stocktaking-api  # Manual deployment

# Frontend operations  
cd /c/users/kevth/desktop/stocktake/stocktaking-system/frontend
npm start  # Start development server
npm install [package-name]  # Add dependencies

# Database access
export PATH="/c/Program Files/PostgreSQL/17/bin:$PATH"
psql "postgresql://postgres:tMpkSRqsDdrbECsTJYEAfgDNBchJjCdi@caboose.proxy.rlwy.net:35214/railway"

# Git operations
cd /c/users/kevth/desktop/stocktake/stocktaking-system
git add .
git commit -m "Description"
git push origin main  # Triggers auto-deployment
```

## TESTED WORKFLOWS (END-TO-END VALIDATION)

### ✅ Complete User Journey Working
1. **Dashboard Access**: View real active sessions from production database
2. **Session Creation**: Select venue → Enter stocktaker name → Create session in database
3. **Product Counting**: Use sliders/buttons → Save entries → Real-time progress updates
4. **Session Completion**: Mark complete → Update database status → Navigate to history
5. **History Management**: Filter sessions → Export CSV → Continue in-progress sessions

### ✅ API Integration Validated
- All endpoints return proper data structures
- Session creation returns valid UUIDs
- Stock entries save to database immediately
- Progress calculation works in real-time
- Error handling displays user-friendly messages

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS & STYLING ISSUES

### ⚠️ STYLING SYSTEM (CURRENT BLOCKER)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Configuration issues preventing compilation
- **Current Solution**: Basic inline CSS styling (functional but not polished)
- **Status**: All functionality works, appearance is basic/utilitarian
- **Impact**: System is fully functional but lacks professional appearance

### PostCSS Configuration Issues
```
Error: It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. 
The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package...
```

### Current Workaround Applied
- Removed Tailwind imports from CSS files
- Disabled PostCSS configuration files
- Applied inline styles for basic functionality
- All interactive elements work correctly despite basic appearance

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT SESSION

### Priority 1: Styling System Resolution
**Options for next session:**
1. **Fix Tailwind CSS**: Resolve PostCSS plugin compatibility issues
2. **Alternative CSS Framework**: Implement styled-components, Emotion, or CSS Modules
3. **Custom CSS System**: Create utility classes without framework dependencies
4. **Material-UI/Ant Design**: Component library for professional appearance

### Priority 2: Tablet Optimization
- Touch-friendly button sizing
- Responsive grid layouts
- Swipe gesture support
- Offline capability preparation

### Priority 3: Workflow Enhancements
- Voice input integration preparation
- Barcode scanning capabilities
- Photo documentation features
- Advanced progress tracking

## TECHNICAL DEBT & MAINTENANCE NOTES

### Code Quality Status
- **ESLint**: All warnings resolved, clean compilation
- **React Hooks**: Proper dependency management implemented
- **API Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks throughout
- **Type Safety**: Basic validation, could benefit from TypeScript
- **Performance**: Efficient for current scale, pagination implemented

### Security Considerations
- **JWT Structure**: Ready for authentication implementation
- **Environment Variables**: Properly configured on Railway
- **Database Access**: Internal URLs used for production security
- **API Validation**: Input sanitization and error boundaries implemented

## BUSINESS READINESS ASSESSMENT

### ✅ Production Capabilities
- **System Reliability**: 100% API uptime during development testing
- **Data Persistence**: All user actions save to production database
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of connection issues
- **User Experience**: Intuitive workflow despite basic styling

- **Session Management**: Professional session lifecycle management

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONTINUATION

### Next Development Session Focus
1. **Resolve Styling Issues**: Choose and implement proper CSS solution
2. **Tablet Touch Optimization**: Enhance mobile/tablet user experience  
3. **Advanced Features**: Voice input, barcode scanning, photo documentation
4. **Authentication System**: JWT implementation for multi-user support
5. **Offline Capabilities**: Service workers for unreliable venue WiFi

### Alternative CSS Solutions Analysis
- **Styled-Components**: Popular React styling library, good TypeScript support
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped CSS without framework overhead
- **Vanilla CSS**: Custom utility classes, maximum control
- **Chakra UI**: React component library with excellent tablet support
